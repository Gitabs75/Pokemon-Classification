This is the ReadME file for the project.
The Project has been formatted as required. 
The Image dataset is the set of URLs in the Grand.csv file. You will find the same CSV file in the GitHub link in the Proposal. These have been downloaded and you will find them in the Images folder. 
Another file, Data.csv, contains the filenames of all the images used alongside their labels. This is also the entirety of the dataset.
